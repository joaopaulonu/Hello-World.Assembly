# Hello-World.Assembly

This project marks my initial experience with Assembly, a low-level programming language that communicates directly with the computer's hardware.

The code within this repository is a simple "Hello, World!" program, designed to be executed using the MASM/TASM extension in Visual Studio Code. This serves as a foundational step in my journey to understand how software interacts with hardware at a deeper level.

Assembly is a complex language that requires a significant shift in thinking compared to high-level languages like Python or Java. While challenging, I am committed to advancing my studies and gradually mastering its principles. This project is a testament to that learning process and my dedication to expanding my programming skills.
